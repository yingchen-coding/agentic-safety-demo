# Agentic Safety Demo

> **One-command demonstration of the complete safety loop: Discovery → Conversion → Gating → Learning. Built for interviews, internal demos, and stakeholder communication.**

A unified end-to-end demonstration of the closed-loop safety system: Stress Testing → Regression → Release Gate → Incident Replay.

**Single responsibility**: Orchestrate + Visualize + Tell the Story.

**This repo does NOT:**
- ❌ Implement evaluation algorithms (eval-pipeline's job)
- ❌ Make release decisions (regression-suite's job)
- ❌ Run incident analysis (incident-lab's job)

**This repo ONLY:**
- ✅ Orchestrates the 4-step flow
- ✅ Produces human-readable outputs
- ✅ Demonstrates the closed-loop in 47 seconds

---

## Motivation

Individual safety components are necessary but not sufficient. Production-grade safety requires a **closed-loop system** where:

1. **Discovery**: Red-teaming surfaces delayed failures
2. **Regression**: Failures become permanent tests
3. **Gating**: Release decisions are automated
4. **Learning**: Incidents feed back into the system

This demo walks through the complete loop in 5 minutes.

---

## 5-Minute End-to-End Demo

### Step 0: Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yingchen-coding/agentic-safety-demo
cd agentic-safety-demo
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or run everything with one command:

```bash
make demo
```

---

### Step 1: Discover Delayed Failures (Stress Tests)

```bash
python scripts/step1_run_stress_tests.py --rollouts 50
```

**What happens:**
- Runs adaptive red-teaming against target model
- Discovers delayed policy erosion failures
- Generates failure distribution over turns

**Output:** `artifacts/stress_failures.json`

---

### Step 2: Generate Regression Tests from Failures

```bash
python scripts/step2_generate_regression.py --input artifacts/stress_failures.json
```

**What happens:**
- Converts discovered failures into structured regression tests
- Tags each test with failure taxonomy and severity
- Creates permanent test cases for CI/CD

**Output:** `artifacts/regression_tests.json`

---

### Step 3: Gate a Candidate Model Release

```bash
python scripts/step3_run_release_gate.py --baseline v1 --candidate v2
```

**What happens:**
- Runs regression suite against baseline and candidate
- Computes statistical significance of any regressions
- Produces OK / WARN / BLOCK verdict

**Output:** `artifacts/gate_report.html`, exit code (0=OK, 1=WARN, 2=BLOCK)

---

### Step 4: Replay a Production Incident

```bash
python scripts/step4_replay_incident.py --incident artifacts/incident_example.json
```

**What happens:**
- Replays a simulated production incident
- Labels root cause and estimates blast radius
- Emits new regression tests to prevent recurrence

**Output:** Incident summary, new tests added to regression suite

---

## Expected Demo Output

```
$ make demo

=== Step 1: Stress Testing ===
Running 50 adaptive rollouts...
Discovered 12 delayed failures
Saved to artifacts/stress_failures.json

=== Step 2: Regression Generation ===
Generated 8 regression tests from 12 failures
Saved to artifacts/regression_tests.json

=== Step 3: Release Gate ===
Running regression suite...
  Baseline (v1): 94.2% pass rate
  Candidate (v2): 87.5% pass rate
  Delta: -6.7% (p=0.003)
Release verdict: BLOCK
Report saved to artifacts/gate_report.html

=== Step 4: Incident Replay ===
Replaying incident INC-2024-001...
  Root cause: policy_erosion
  Blast radius: 1,247 affected conversations
  New regression tests: 2
Incident loop complete.

=== Demo Complete ===
Total time: 47 seconds
```

### Demo Mode (Interview-Friendly)

```bash
python demo.py --demo-mode
```

Outputs narrated progress that explains itself:

```
[1/4] Running stress tests... Found 12 delayed failures (slow-burn vulnerabilities)
[2/4] Converting failures into regressions... Generated 8 new tests
[3/4] Running release gate... ❌ BLOCK (safety regression -6.7%, p=0.003)
[4/4] Replaying incident INC-2024-001... 1,247 conversations affected → 2 tests promoted

Demo completed in 47s.
```

**Why this matters**: Interviewers see your screen and understand what's happening without explanation.

## System Constitution

> **The governing framework that defines how the 8-repo system operates.**

The System Constitution is the explicit contract that eliminates ambiguity about boundaries, authority, and data flows. Located in [`docs/constitution/`](docs/constitution/).

| Document | Key Question |
|----------|--------------|
| [README.md](docs/constitution/README.md) | How does this governance system work? |
| [metric_definitions.md](docs/constitution/metric_definitions.md) | What exactly does each metric mean? |
| [release_authority.md](docs/constitution/release_authority.md) | Who can block a release? |
| [data_contracts.md](docs/constitution/data_contracts.md) | What format does each repo expect? |
| [failure_escalation_policy.md](docs/constitution/failure_escalation_policy.md) | What happens when something breaks? |
| [observability_standard.md](docs/constitution/observability_standard.md) | How do we debug across repos? |

**Why this matters**: In real safety organizations, systems fail not from missing components but from unclear ownership, authority confusion, and metric drift. This constitution makes implicit contracts explicit.

## Completeness & Limitations

This demo showcases the integration of a closed-loop safety system, demonstrating how discovery, regression, gating, and learning components work together. It is designed for communication and demonstration, not as a production safety system.

**What is complete:**
- End-to-end orchestration of the 4-step safety loop with clear artifacts at each stage
- Interview-friendly demo mode with self-narrating progress output
- Comprehensive documentation covering executive, oncall, governance, and engineering audiences
- CI/CD integration example showing how the release gate fits into deployment pipelines
- Artifact schemas documenting the machine-readable contracts between components

**Key limitations:**
- **Demonstration scope:** This repo orchestrates but does not implement the underlying algorithms. Stress testing, evaluation, and incident analysis logic lives in separate repos.
- **Synthetic data:** Demo outputs use simulated data to illustrate the flow; real deployments require integration with actual model evaluations.
- **Single-machine execution:** The demo runs locally for simplicity; production systems require distributed infrastructure.
- **Static scenarios:** The demo uses fixed scenarios; real systems need dynamic scenario generation and rotation.

**Future work:**
- Interactive dashboard for exploring demo artifacts
- Integration with real model APIs for live evaluation runs
- Multi-tenant demo mode for team presentations

---

## What This Repo Is NOT

- This is not a production safety system; it demonstrates architecture patterns only.
- This is not a replacement for the underlying evaluation, regression, and incident repos.
- This is not a comprehensive test suite; it showcases the integration flow.
- The 47-second runtime is demonstration-optimized; real pipelines may take longer.
