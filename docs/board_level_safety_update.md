# Board-Level Safety Update (1 Page)

Audience: Board of Directors
Purpose: Provide concise, decision-relevant view of safety posture.

---

## 1. Executive Summary (TL;DR)

**Overall Safety Status:** Green (Stable) / Yellow (Elevated Risk) / Red (Action Required)

- Safety posture this quarter:
- Material change since last update:
- Recommendation: Proceed / Pause / De-risk before expansion

---

## 2. Key Risks (Top 3)

| Risk | Trend | Business Impact | Mitigation Status |
|------|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Delayed misuse in multi-turn workflows | Up | Reputational, regulatory | Stress tests expanded |
| Tool misuse blast radius | Flat | Customer harm | Kill-switch deployed |
| Detector drift on novel attacks | Up | Policy non-compliance | Adaptive red-team in progress |

---

## 3. Safety Performance vs Targets

| Metric | Target | Current | Trend |
|--------|--------|---------|-------|
| Safety violation rate | <= 0.10% | 0.07% | Down |
| Delayed failure rate | <= 0.03% | 0.02% | Flat |
| Escaped incidents (SEV-1) | 0 / quarter | 0 | Flat |
| Canary safety delta | >= 0 | +0.4% | Up |

Interpretation:
- Are we getting safer over time?
- Are recent releases improving or regressing safety?

---

## 4. Notable Incidents & Learnings

- Incident summary (1-2 bullets)
- Root cause category (e.g., policy erosion, tool misuse)
- What changed as a result (new regression tests, new safeguards)

---

## 5. Forward-Looking Risks (Next Quarter)

- Emerging misuse patterns
- Product expansion increasing blast radius
- Known residual risks accepted

---

## 6. Management Requests / Decisions Needed

Board input requested on:
- Risk appetite for new agentic capabilities
- Approval for slower rollout to increase safety coverage
- Investment in safety infra (headcount / budget)

---

## 7. Appendix (Optional, not shown on slide)

- Detailed metrics
- Incident timelines
- Audit notes
