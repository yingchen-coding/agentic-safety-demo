# Annual Safety Roadmap (Strategic Investment Plan)

Audience: Board, Executive Leadership
Purpose: Define annual safety priorities, investments, and measurable outcomes.

---

## 1. Strategic Objectives (12-Month Horizon)

1. Prevent safety regressions in model releases
2. Reduce delayed failure rates in agentic workflows
3. Operationalize continuous red-teaming
4. Shorten incident remediation time
5. Improve regulator and auditor readiness

---

## 2. Priority Initiatives

| Initiative | Objective | Success Metric | Owner |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| Safety regression gating | Enforce non-regression | 100% releases gated | Safety Eng |
| Trajectory-level evals | Catch slow-burn failures | -40% delayed failures | Safety Res |
| Automated red-teaming | Proactive discovery | Weekly coverage growth | Safety Eng |
| Incident-to-regression loop | Close feedback loop | <7 days to new test | Safety Eng |
| Production safety dashboards | Real-time visibility | Live SLO tracking | Platform |
| Third-party risk governance | Dependency control | Annual vendor audits | Legal |
